## About the Project

The Salifort Motors project seeks to answer:  
> *What factors are most likely to make an employee leave the company?*

Using exploratory data analysis and machine learning models (decision tree, random forest, logistic regression), the project identifies key factors such as:  
- Last evaluation score  
- Number of projects  
- Tenure  
- Overwork  
- Salary  
- Work accidents  

These insights help HR design better policies to **improve retention** and **reduce employee turnover**.
